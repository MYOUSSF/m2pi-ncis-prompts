    "# Generating Prompts Using Structure and Synonyms\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate a protocol for generating search engine prompts of a given structure. We propose that prompts should be of the form \"Watercraft\" + \"Crime\" + \"Consequence\" + \"Specifics\" where each term in the sequence is randomly generated from a list of keywords. The \"Specifics\" term should be optional and can be used to generate prompts that can yield more specific incident reports. Examples of specific information that could be included are types of fish and geographic areas.\n",

    "## Generating Keyword Lists for Each Term\n",
