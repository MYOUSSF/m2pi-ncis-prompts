NCIS is developing software to identify, track, and build profiles for vessels involved in incidents at sea. This software intends to use a large language model to collect and analyze publicly available web data. With a predefined list of incident categories, the algorithm will gather relevant information about vessels and their reported incidents. It will filter this data to focus solely on incident reports, extracting key details such as vessel name, flag state, and company for any vessel involved in the report. This information will be used to create comprehensive profiles of the reported vessels.

## Leveraging NLP to Generate High Quality Search Engine Prompts

This project aims to leverage natural language processing techniques to generate search engine prompts that yield high-quality results. Quality indicators include relevance, diversity, soundness, and minimizing bias. Our goal is to develop a system that generates diverse and relevant search prompts to web scrape publicly available incident reports on the given topic. Time permitting, we aim to develop a dynamic prompt generation system that optimizes search engine prompts to web scrape publicly available incident reports on the given topic.
