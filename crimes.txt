    - Unreported At-Sea Processing: Processing fish at sea without reporting the activities, often to obscure the
    quantity or species of the catch.
    - Catch Inflation: Exaggerating the size or weight of catches in reports to meet minimum size requirements
    or market demands fraudulently.
    - Undocumented Landings at Sea: Landing fish onto unregulated or unmonitored vessels at sea to avoid
    reporting requirements.
    - Data Falsification: Deliberately entering false data into electronic reporting systems to mislead regulators
    about catches.
    - Unreported Recreational Fishing: Failing to report catches from recreational fishing activities that may
    contribute to total catch limits.
    - Multiple Logbooks: Maintaining multiple sets of logbooks with different records to deceive inspectors and
    regulators.
    - Unreported Land-Based Processing: Processing fish at land-based facilities without reporting the
    activities to obscure the true quantity or species of the catch.
    - Quarantine Misreporting: Misreporting catches to avoid quarantine regulations or to expedite market

    - Transshipment Underreporting: Not fully reporting the amount of fish transferred during transshipment
    operations to obscure true catch amounts.
    - Landing Mismatches: Reporting catches at landings that do not match the actual catch in terms of species
    or weight, often due to transferring catch at sea.
    - Unreported Incidental Catch: Failing to report incidental or non-target species caught during fishing
    operations to avoid penalties or bycatch limits.
    - Catch Transfer Manipulation: Misreporting the amount of catch transferred between different phases of the
